## Problem Description
### Part 1
part one asks for depth and horizontal positon and to multiply the two this is solved by assigning the values to two integers and increaseing them or decreasingt them based on the first character for each in each list , since the list follows a predictable pattern and only features one digit numbers this can then refer to the position in each string that contains the number and convert to integer to to increase or decrease each variable.

### Part 2
part 2 introduces aim as another value to determine depth by multiplying the horizontal value by the aim.This can reuse this same code while slightly changing that for the horizontal calculation to modify the depth variable

## Usage

### Part 1
```bash
python day2solutionpt1.py
